Let $\mathbf{P}^{m}_{b}(x)$ be a $2m+1$-degree polynomial in $x$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$,
\[
    \mathbf{P}^{m}_{b}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{b-1} \sum_{r=0}^{m} \mathbf{A}_{m,r} k^r (x-k)^r,
\]
where $\mathbf{A}_{m,r}$ are real coefficients.
In this manuscript, we introduce the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^{m}_{b}(x)$ and study its properties,
establishing a polynomial identity for odd-powers in terms of this polynomial.
Based on mentioned polynomial identity for odd-powers,
we explore the connection between the Binomial theorem and discrete convolution of odd-powers,
further extending this relation to the multinomial case.
All findings are verified using symbolic computation in Mathematica.
