Let $\mathbf{P}^{m}_{b}(x)$ be a $2m+1$-degree integer-valued polynomial in $b,x\in\mathbb{R}$
\[
    \mathbf{P}^{m}_{b}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{b-1} \sum_{r=0}^{m} \mathbf{A}_{m,r} k^r(x-k)^r,
\]
where $\mathbf{A}_{m,r}$ is a real coefficient.
In this manuscript we establish a relation between Binomial theorem and polynomial $\mathbf{P}^{m}_{b}(x)$.
Furthermore, a relationship between Binomial theorem and discrete convolution in terms of polynomials is provided.
