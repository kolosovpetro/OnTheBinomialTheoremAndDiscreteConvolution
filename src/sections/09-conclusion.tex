In this manuscript, we introduced the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^{m}_{b}(x)$ and examined its properties.
We established a polynomial identity for odd-powers that demonstrates the connection between Binomial theorem
and discrete convolution of odd-powered polynomials.
This relationship was extended to the multinomial case.
All results were verified using Mathematica programs.
